# Instagram Bot by Kshitij Bhatnagar
Growing an audience is an expensive and painful task. And if you’d like to build an audience that’s relevant to you, and shares common interests, that’s even more difficult.After some research, I realized how some users basically crawl for followers. They comment, like and follow people — looking for a follow back. Only to unfollow them again in the next days.And that is why we’re here, so let’s get to it! I came up with a simple bot in Python, while I was messing around with Selenium and trying to figure out some project to use it. Simply put, Selenium is like a browser you can interact with very easily in Python.

  - Selenium

# New Features!

  - You can Like
  - You can Follow
  - And Yes, You can Comment too...

You’ll need Python (I’m using Python 3.7), Selenium, a browser (in my case I’ll be using Chrome) and… obviously, an Instagram account! Quick overview regarding what the bot will do:
Open a browser and login with your credentials
For every hashtag in the hashtag list, it will open the page and click the first picture to open it
It will then like, follow, comment and move to the next picture, in a 200 iterations loop (number can be adjusted)
Saves a list with all the users you followed using the bot

### Installation

Instagram Post Downloader requires [Chrome WebDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)  to run.

Install the dependencies. This is one time process.

```sh
